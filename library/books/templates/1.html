         <p>Was Felix Mendelssohn (1809—1847) a great composer? On its face, the question seems absurd. One of the most
            gifted prodigies in the history of music, he produced his first masterpiece at sixteen. From then on, he was
            recognized as an artist of preternatural abilities, not only as a composer but also as a pianist and
            conductor. But
            Mendelssohn’s enduring popularity has often been at odds — sometimes quite sharply — with his critical
            standing.
            Despite general acknowledgment of his genius, there has been a noticeable reluctance to rank him with, say,
            Schumann or Brahms. As Haggin put it, Mendelssohn, as a composer, was a “minor master … working on a small
            scale of emotion and texture.</p>
